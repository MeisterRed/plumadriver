<h1>PlumaDriver</h1>

<p>PlumaDriver is a JavaScript implementation of the W3C WebDriver standards using 
the JSDOM library to emulate the remote end node (browser) in the chain of nodes.
More information about JSDOM can be found <a href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">here</a></p>

<h2>Try out JSDOM!</h2>
<h3>Requirements: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>To get started, clone the repository and make sure that you have NodeJS installed. If you don't have NodeJS, you may download it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">here</a>. Once inside the repository directory, open a terminal window and type in 'npm install'. This will use the node package manager (NPM) to install all the dependencies required for PlumaDriver to work. Once this step is completed, you may try out plumadriver by modifying the code inside the main function in index.js, found in the root directory of the project.
